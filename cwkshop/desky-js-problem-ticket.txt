I realize my support has expired.  But my client has been using wooshop  for a while now and up til how has used it primarily as a catalog site.  Now she wants to be able to sell her products.  

However, there seems to be a problem with the js script for the plus and minus buttons in global/quantity-input.php.  It works fine if there is only one product in the shopping cart, but if there is more than one product in the shopping cart a click on any + or - sign will update the quantity of the  first item by the number of items in the shopping cart.

Probably because the js is included for each item in the shopping cart in the quantity-input.php, but each item has the same id:  qty-val.  Thus there are n number scripts that run and update the first #qty-val ti finds.  

Any help here would be much appreciated.  

Wooshop theme version : 2.3.1
Wordpress version:   4.3.1
